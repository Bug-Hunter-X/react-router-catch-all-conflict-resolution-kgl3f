# React Router Catch-All Route Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router's catch-all route (`*`). When a catch-all route (`<Route path="*" />`) is present in `Routes`, it can sometimes interfere with other routes, particularly nested routes, leading to unexpected rendering behavior or navigation problems.

## Problem

The problem typically arises when nested routes are combined with a catch-all route. The catch-all route can unintentionally capture all routes, even those that should be handled by nested routes. The order of routes in the `Routes` component can play a role in this behavior.

## Solution

This issue can often be solved by carefully ordering routes. Placing the catch-all route last ensures that it only matches when no other routes are matched. 

Another approach is using a more specific catch-all route path, ensuring that it does not conflict with other existing routes.
